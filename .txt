[Verse]
Today’s the day we light the flame
The candles dance
They spell your name
Juan
It’s your moment
Don’t be shy
Blow them out and touch the sky

[Chorus]
Feliz Juan-Day
Let’s all cheer
The party’s loud
The vibe is clear
Feliz Juan-Day
Take the floor
It’s your day
Juan
never enough

[Verse 2]
Piñatas swing
The colors fly
Laughter’s loud
It fills the sky
Cake so sweet
Just like you
Juan
Let the celebration begin

[Prechorus]
The music calls
The congas play
Dance, it’s your party

[Chorus]
Feliz Juan-Day
Let’s all cheer
The party’s loud
The vibe is clear
Feliz Juan-Day
Take the floor
It’s your day
Juan
never enough

[Bridge]
One year older
But who’s to count
Life’s an endless
Joyful fount
Raise your glass
Toast to the fun
Here’s to you
The one and only Juan
